# **Introduction:**

Everything around us contains some sort of data, whether it’s documented or not. An action, a series of events or words are all examples of data. This brings forward the discussion of what is computable data and what is not. It entertains the idea that data is there only to convey a message, to host information, or even to tell a story. All the mentioned instances that come with data are recorded whether it’s through a dataset, a computer machine, or our minds. Once something is recorded on a computer, especially on the internet, it usually has some sort of metadata. Metadata is a term used to refer to pieces of information that can be used to easily track down information online. Metadata is often bluntly mentioned on websites that showcase artifacts or art, and it can even be found through sly codes and search files. One example would be *The Digital Library of The Middle East (DLME)*. *The DLME* houses over 100,000 objects within dozens of collections found across multiple museums around the world.


The resources found on the *DLME* website can be extremely useful for many different purposes. It allows people from all around the world to have easy access to thousands of historical pieces that are filled with rich culture. One other major pro for the *DLME* can be the somewhat great amount of information about every specific object with embedded links to the original creator and current host of the items. It also shows the views the objects display throughout different museums, if any. This form of information tracking provides a clear sense of transparency on the wanted object’s discoverability. This means that it makes it easier to locate a target webpage that contains a specific object, for example, even by using bits of data that are scattered across different websites. All of this is possible thanks to the presence of metadata. The entire basis of metadata exists on the functionality of the search bars and discoverability. To better understand the idea of discoverability, one should research specifics about a certain item, like the title, date, author/artist, and the holding institution. This filters all of the possible available resources, otherwise, the targeted search result might not even show up.


Below, in **Figure 1**, are two images of similar posters discussing conflict within the Palestinian land and community originally displayed/housed on the *Palestine Poster Project (PPP)* website. As both of them originate from the same website and project, their imported metadata into The DLME is of a similar nature and format. **Figure 2 (Table)** below showcases the metadata in the categorized fashion they are present in *The DLME*. **Figure 3 (Table)** further down showcases the metadata on the PPP’s website. The chosen images (posters) are unique in the messages they hold/present and their artistic style, however, as mentioned above, it’s expected for them both to have really similar metadata given their similar origins.

The metadata showcased in **Figure 2** seems to be very surface level and uninformative. It generally tells us very basic information about the painting. The only categories that can be excluded from this are ‘title’, ‘creator’, and ‘description’. These three categories provide unique information about the specific pieces themselves instead of hinting at a bigger collection of work. Unlike the ‘type (broader)’, ‘type (narrower)’, and ‘subject’ categories that serve no major significance in filtering out the targeted posters within a sea of other posters, the ‘holding institution’ and ‘data provider’ categories actually lead the search closer towards the collection specific to the PPP. Although still challenging and limiting, it still provides room for greater discoverability. Since both ‘holding institution’ and ‘data provider’ state “Palestine Poster Project Archive”, searching that alone would inevitably lead to the *PPP* website and make locating the posters through the website itself way easier.
The metadata collected from *The DLME* feels incomplete, especially the description of the posters as they just reiterate the creator’s name and year of creation. The description slot would ideally possess keywords that would allude to the object/image itself. On the other hand, the metadata collected from the PPP (the original host of the posters) feels a bit more closer to the target object/item with more descriptive/telling categories as well as embedded links to more information, like the creator’s personal website. The categories present on the *PPP* website vary in clarity within the discoverability of the posters themselves, and some of them are ‘language’, ‘published in’, ‘iconography’, and ‘related links’. These more obscure categories allow for niche searches and a greater possibility for discoverability regardless of the combination of metadata used to locate the origin of the item (posters).
