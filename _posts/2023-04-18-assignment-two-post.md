# An Analysis of *My Friend the Murderer* by Arthur Conan Doyle via Voyant Tools:

## 1. Introduction (What is a Corpus?):
The way data is contained around us can either make data analysis way easier or just more difficult and tedious. This mostly depends on the amount of data found and its quality. Data comes in a variety of fashions, like images, signals, videos, and most commonly, text. Huge chunks of text collected together are referred to as a corpus, basically a specific set of text that contains a significant amount of data and information about anything really.

When working with a corpus, prior basic knowledge to its contents deems significant as one can use it to build further knowledge. Different corpora can have different usages, and understanding each possible usage can lead to knowing what corpus would be better for the job. This also goes hand-in-hand with the methods used to analyze the chosen corpus. In this case, my goal is to analyze a corpus through Voyant Tools or the R Markdown Files. I'll be focusing on utilizing the various visualization tools that are made available with the Voyant Tools web-based analysis tools as I find them really interactive and clear. For my corpus, I'll delve into the *Doyle* Corpus, and mainly, *"My Friend the Murderer"* by Arthur Conan Doyle.

## 2. Motives:
For this blog entry (assignment #2), I persoanlly want to understand the significant dichotomy that arises from the interactions that AI programs have with archival data sets. AI is rapidly growing everyday, and knowing how that influences old archival sets and corpora is very interesting to me. I personally enjoy understanding whether this interaction is beneficial or not and to weight out the pros and cons to better tell whether AI is more disruptive than it is helpful.
Another idea I wish to better grasp after this analysis is that if corpora always contain related data sets or not. As mentioned above, I'll focus on Doyle's *"My Friend the Murderer"*, however, I will not shy away from comparing it to other parts of the corpus if anything interesting or suspicous captures my attention.

### 2.1 Why *My Friend the Murderer*?:



## 3. *"My Friend the Murderer"* and Doyle:
Arthur Conan Doyle was born to British origins on the 22nd of May, 1859. He pursued a medical career as a physician and became a writier of ficiton, science fiction,, fantasy, and non fiction. One of Doyle's most notable pieces of work would be the invention of the fictional character of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes then went on to become one of the most famous and recognizable names in the literary world. The growth of Holmes as a character played a major role in expanding the fictional world and turning it into a cinematic one as well. The Sherlock Holmes character appeared in more than 40 movies, animated ones too. The franchise then delved deeper into the detective Holmes universe exploring character like his sister, Enola Holmes, in *Enola Holmes 1* and *Enola Holmes 2*.

### 3.1 My Personal Prior Knowledge:
I personally had basic, surface-level, exposure to Arthur Conan Doyle and his work. I grew up watching Sherlock Holmes and then had a disconnect. My most recent exposure to this character, although limited, was through the *Enola Holmes* movies. My knowledge of this data set is limited to Holmes being a detective and Doyle being a writer. I had no past conception of him maintaining a medical career, and I had little to no ideas surrounding Doyle's other works of fiction and fantasy.

## 4. Analysis through Voyant Tools:
*Voyant Tools* is an online-based reading and analysis that disects digital texts and corpora to gauge a better understanding of the overall themes and possible plot points via visual learning diagrams.
 *Voyant Tools* presents numerous interfaces that texts can be analyzed through, like Corpus Tools (creating a word cloud), Document Tools, Visualization Tools, Grid Tools, and a variety of other tools that can summarize the numbers surrounding the text of the corpus.

The first set of tools that *Voyant Tools* handles are wordclouds, termsberries, and line graphs with relative trends. Other tools require manual searches through the webpage, and they aren't difficult to find at all.

### 4.1 ***Presented below are the wordcloud, termsberries, and line graphs of *My Friend the Murderer* through *Voyant Tools*:***

All of these 3 initial visualizations of the text briefly showcase the general consistent composition of words used throughout the uploaded corpus.

1. **The word cloud** (on the far left) provides a visualized overview of the terms found within the corpus. It showcases how frequent the words are based on their sizes. The more frequent it is mentioned, the bigger its size is.
2. Similar to the word cloud, **the termberries** (in the middle) showcases the frequency of the words but in bubble form. The bigger the bubble, the more frequent the word is. However, the termberries tool also allows us to visualize the occurence of these words next to each other in the corpus. When you hover over a bubble, it showcases other bubbles in blue. This makes it clear that these words frequently appear together in the corpus.
3. **The line graph** (on the far right) is used to horizontaly establish the relative frequencies of words across the corpus. It also helps by clearly  showcasing the frequencies across the corpus's timeline, from the start of it to its end.
