# An Analysis of *My Friend the Murderer* by Arthur Conan Doyle using Voyant Tools:

## 1. Introduction (What is a Corpus?):
The way data is contained around us can either make data analysis way easier or just more difficult and tedious. This mostly depends on the amount of data found and its quality. Data comes in a variety of fashions, like images, signals, videos, and most commonly, text. Huge chunks of text collected together are referred to as a corpus, basically a specific set of text that contains a significant amount of data and information about anything really.

When working with a corpus, prior basic knowledge to its contents deems significant as one can use it to build further knowledge. Different corpora can have different usages, and understanding each possible usage can lead to knowing what corpus would be better for the job. This also goes hand-in-hand with the methods used to analyze the chosen corpus. In this case, my goal is to analyze a corpus through Voyant Tools or the R Markdown Files. I'll be focusing on utilizing the various visualization tools that are made available with the Voyant Tools web-based analysis tools as I find them really interactive and clear. For my corpus, I'll delve into the *Doyle* Corpus, and mainly, *"My Friend the Murderer"* by Arthur Conan Doyle.

## 2. Motives:
For this blog entry (assignment #2), I personally want to understand the significant dichotomy that arises from the interactions that AI programs have with archival data sets. AI is rapidly growing everyday, and knowing how that influences old archival sets and corpora is very interesting to me. I personally enjoy understanding whether this interaction is beneficial or not and to weight out the pros and cons to better tell whether AI is more disruptive than it is helpful.
Another idea I wish to better grasp after this analysis is that if corpora always contain related data sets or not. As mentioned above, I'll focus on Doyle's *"My Friend the Murderer"*, however, I will not shy away from comparing it to other parts of the corpus if anything interesting or suspicous captures my attention.

### 2.1 Why *My Friend the Murderer*?:
I personally chose *My Friend the Murderer* by Arthur Conan Doyle because of its intriguing title. How can you befriend a murderer? I wanted to understand how such title can house specific themes that are prominent throughout an entire set of text. Understanding the pattern of words or context that gets brought up in a book, or any piece of text in generel, is quite important ot the theme and general plot/trend of ideas throughout the passage. In his book *In Praise of Pattern* Stephen Ramsay talks baout how using text analysis tools to understand the connection between "the computational strictures of text analysis and the open-ended interpretive landscape of literary studies" (Ramsay, 2005)(1).
His appraoch to digital text analysis is that of a visual one. His endeavor of creating *StageGraph* as a tool for visualizing "dramatic structure", and the main idea behind his argument is that the usage of online visualization tools is valid in the run of analyzing texts. Connecting his work an dunderstanding the "Graph Theory" in the way it underlines computational location mechanisms with digital settings proves that text analysis can provide a pattern for thought and understanding.

## 3. *"My Friend the Murderer"* and Doyle:
Arthur Conan Doyle was born to British origins on the 22nd of May, 1859. He pursued a medical career as a physician and became a writier of ficiton, science fiction,, fantasy, and non fiction. One of Doyle's most notable pieces of work would be the invention of the fictional character of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes then went on to become one of the most famous and recognizable names in the literary world. The growth of Holmes as a character played a major role in expanding the fictional world and turning it into a cinematic one as well. The Sherlock Holmes character appeared in more than 40 movies, animated ones too. The franchise then delved deeper into the detective Holmes universe exploring character like his sister, Enola Holmes, in *Enola Holmes 1* and *Enola Holmes 2*.

### 3.1 My Personal Prior Knowledge:
I personally had basic, surface-level, exposure to Arthur Conan Doyle and his work. I grew up watching Sherlock Holmes and then had a disconnect. My most recent exposure to this character, although limited, was through the *Enola Holmes* movies. My knowledge of this data set is limited to Holmes being a detective and Doyle being a writer. I had no past conception of him maintaining a medical career, and I had little to no ideas surrounding Doyle's other works of fiction and fantasy.

## 4. Analysis through Voyant Tools:
*Voyant Tools* is an online-based reading and analysis that disects digital texts and corpora to gauge a better understanding of the overall themes and possible plot points via visual learning diagrams.
 *Voyant Tools* presents numerous interfaces that texts can be analyzed through, like Corpus Tools (creating a word cloud), Document Tools, Visualization Tools, Grid Tools, and a variety of other tools that can summarize the numbers surrounding the text of the corpus.

The first set of tools that *Voyant Tools* handles are wordclouds, termsberries, and line graphs with relative trends. Other tools require manual searches through the webpage, and they aren't difficult to find at all.

### 4.1 ***Presented below are the wordcloud, termsberries, and line graphs of *My Friend the Murderer* through *Voyant Tools*:***

**Fig.1 *My Friend the Murderer* Word Cloud, Termsberries, and Line Graphs from Voyant Tools**

All of these 3 initial visualizations of the text briefly showcase the general consistent composition of words used throughout the uploaded corpus.

1. **The word cloud** (on the far left) provides a visualized overview of the terms found within the corpus. It showcases how frequent the words are based on their sizes. The more frequent it is mentioned, the bigger its size is.
- In the context of *My Friend the Murderer*, the generated word cloud demonstrates the two most common words as "project" and "gutenberg".

2. Similar to the word cloud, **the termberries** (in the middle) showcases the frequency of the words but in bubble form. The bigger the bubble, the more frequent the word is. However, the termberries tool also allows us to visualize the occurence of these words next to each other in the corpus. When you hover over a bubble, it showcases other bubbles in blue. This makes it clear that these words frequently appear together in the corpus.

3. **The line graph** (on the far right) is used to horizontaly establish the relative frequencies of words across the corpus. It also helps by clearly  showcasing the frequencies across the corpus's timeline, from the start of it to its end.

### 4.2 Grid Tools - Phrases:
The phrases tool under grid tools creates a table that organizes different phrases from the corpus that are repeated. It also counts the times each phrases was repeated and the number of words generally part of said phrase.
This tool is useful when trying to identify the significance of any sentence throughout the entirety of the corpus' text.

**Fig.2 *My Friend the Murderer* Grid Tools - Phrases from Voyant Tools**

Based on the lower rows of the generated table, it is clear that most of them are based on the copyright issues mentioned either at the start or at the end of the book.
This is prevalent throughout msot of the text tools present on *Voyant Tools*, howeever, when prepared in a table like this, it is evident that the phrasing and repitition of the copyrights to Project Gutenberg is mentioned quite a lot:
- "the terms of the full **project**...".
- "about the **project gutenberg**...".
- "copies of **project gutenberg**...".
- "the owner of **project gutenberg**...".

### 4.3 Corpus/Visualization Tools - DreamScape:
Below is showcased a map exported from *Voyant Tool*'s DreamScape visualization tool. This tool analyzes the enitre text and detects specific geographical locations, like cities and countries, and it connects them via a line based on the order they're mentioned in.
The visual aspect of this tool is that it creates a transparent blue circle around the locations mentioned, and the circle's radius determines the times the location was mentioned. The bigger the circle, the more times it is mentioned.
Based on the produced map, we can tell that Florida (and possible closely surrounding areas) are mentioned quite a lot, yet, althought mentioned, Melbourne isn't mentioned as much.
This allows us to tell that the story in hand is most likely taking place in Florida, perhaps with a couple of visits to Melbourne, and/or either locations being mentioned quite a lot without the characters being there.

## 5. Significances and Usages:
*The utilization of vizualization tools while analyzing text is extremely crucial for multiple reasons:*
1. It draws attention to things you might've missed while reading or analyzing.
2. It clearly showcases the links and connections between different statements (that link to possible themes) throughout the text.
3. It clearly represents the consistency of words/phrases to showcase continous plots.
4. It allows for a better understanding of the timeline when words are laid out on a graph to represent the times they've been mentioned and when they've been mentioned.

Developing my own understanding of the visualization tools of text passages has essentially drawn my attention to basic text analysis. The visuals are a bonus. Understanding the basic trends of a given corpus is easier when they're paired together. 

The ideation that comes with text analysis tools almost always brings forward additional interest to the searched topic. Knowing more about it allows for broader research endeavors as well as technological advancements. A research/analysis of the Chinese search trends across social media platforms and websites (1950s - 2008) in comparision to that of the world which has showcased the drastic themes present in search trends basic on geographical location. The research focused on the usage of language in relation to location, and one of their main focuses was on the political search trends questioning why the "political communication" trends in Chinese rank lower than that of other languages, like English, Italian, French, Russian, and Spanish (Clark, et. al, 2022)(2).
Connecting the findings of Clark, et al. to the trends I've found while studying the *My Friend the Murderer*'s corpus has been interesting. I got to know that the way language is used determines how often it's brought up, and I also found it interesting how the consistency of words within a specific geographical location can tell the general trends of whatever is being researched, for example the political stance of people.

## 6. Conclusions:
In conclusion, text analysis of a corpus is extremely important. It paves the way for a better understanding of texts and their contents, and when paired with visuals, it becomes easier to differentiate from what is important and what is not.
