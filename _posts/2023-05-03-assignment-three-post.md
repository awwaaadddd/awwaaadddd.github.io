## 1. Introduction (What is Image-Based Analysis?):
Image analysis is a special type of processing that utilizes pre-existing images to arrange and organize them based on specific characteristics that they may share with one another. Image analysis focuses on the main content of the image, and it then segregates them based on that. This allows for a better understanding of the images' content(s) and the themes they may share.
Images are found everywhere. So, upon grasping the idea of how images can get categorized, one can develop a better understanding on how these images can be used in various alternating fields of work.

**Some Potential Useful Implementations of Image Analysis:
- Creative Works, like poster making and ***Music Albums***.
- Visual Mapping.
- Interior Design through color analysis.
- Security.
- *Construction*.

In a *Review of Image-Based Analysis and Applications in Construction*, Kareem Mostafa & Tarek Hegazy studied multiple papers and have conducted a survey that showcased that image-based analysis if greatly used in construction. Briefly, their research results showed that construction safety, progress monitoring, and damage assessment are the three most common trends across image-based analysis utilization in the construction industry. They further continue to mention that image-based analysis in construction can allude to the job being done or its intensity, with one example referring to a job that requires hardhats (Tarek & Hegazy, 2021)[1].
