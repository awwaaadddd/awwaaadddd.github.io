    ## Scope:
    This project focuses on tackeling incorrect social media captions and messages by forging together an AI system that detects inconsistent translations across social media platforms that communicate incoherent ideas.
    The main idea it approaches is language, mainly dialects. Lots of dialects are inproperly docummented online that translation processes are almost always slightly off.
