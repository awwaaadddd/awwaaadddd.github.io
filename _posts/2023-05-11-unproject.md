   ## Workplan:
    1. Collect data from Instagram Posts.
    2. The team detect comments not in English, usually in Emirati Arabic.
    4. Categorize the data based on the degree of inaccuracies.
    5. Understand the inaccurate translations in the context of the post.
    6. Process the inaccuracies through a curated database.
    7. Check if the captions pass as accurate or inaccurate.
    8. Develop an webpage that hosts this program.
    9. Create a public trial run of the program that can be tested by people.
    10. Implement people's suggestions and possibly expand the database with
