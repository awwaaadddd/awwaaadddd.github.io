# Step 1 - Chat GPT's Provided Answer:
- Exactly as is from the Google Drive:

As a 20 year old university student studying digital humanities, I am constantly learning about how to effectively utilize technology in my daily and academic life. Growing up in the digital age, I have always been familiar with various social media platforms and online tools for content creation. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities.
In my daily life, I mainly use social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter to connect with friends and family, as well as to follow my favorite influencers and brands. I have always appreciated the convenience and accessibility of these platforms for staying connected with others. However, I have also become more aware of the potential risks and limitations of relying too heavily on social media, such as the impact on mental health and privacy concerns.

For content creation, I use a variety of tools such as Canva and Adobe Spark to create graphics and videos for personal projects. I have also recently discovered the potential of using video editing software like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere to enhance my content and make it more visually appealing.

In terms of research data management, I have primarily relied on Google Drive for storing and organizing my academic papers and projects. I have also used Microsoft Excel for basic data analysis, such as creating charts and graphs. However, I have come to realize that these tools may not always be sufficient for more complex data manipulation and analysis.

The digital humanities course has opened my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I have learned about tools such as Tableau and Gephi for data visualization and network analysis, as well as programming languages like Python and R for data manipulation and analysis. I am fascinated by the potential of these tools to revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

Despite my prior experience with technology and my newfound knowledge from the digital humanities course, I still feel that my abilities in this area are limited. I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field.

In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been eye-opening and enriching. I have come to appreciate the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis, and I am eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools in my academic and professional life. While I have some basic skills in content creation and social interaction, I am aware that there is still much more to learn and I am eager to continue to expand my knowledge and abilities in this area.

# Step 3 - Rewritten Version:
- Rewritten to reflect my progress.

I am currently a sophomore student at New York University Abu Dhabi majoring in psychology and minoring in visual arts. I am taking a digital humanities class, ***Introduction to Digital Arts & Humanities***, alongside my major and minor requirment classes. Growing up in a digital world, I have always been interested in the digital realm and what goes on within it. So, taking this digital humanities course has been greatly informative and helpful. I have always been surrounded by media and different platforms with many usages, like convenience and academic support. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities. Nevertheless, this class has been teaching me about specific tools that can satisfy specific needs within the digital lens. 

I use social media, especially Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat, every day to keep up with friends and family. I use it to follow my favorite influences and social media accounts too. Most of the content I follow online is fashion and music based. I am always glad that social media is often easy to use and manage. It brings lots of conveience in communicating with others and expressing messages to a louder audience, and you often get to pick your target audience through hashtags and the accounts you tag or follow. However, social media feels addicting most of the time and getting out of the loop feels hard from time to time. This is reflective of the algorithm's nature of being never-ending. That's one of the cons of social media, especially that its easilly accessible.
