# Step 1 - Chat GPT's Provided Answer:
- Exactly as is from the Google Drive:

As a 20 year old university student studying digital humanities, I am constantly learning about how to effectively utilize technology in my daily and academic life. Growing up in the digital age, I have always been familiar with various social media platforms and online tools for content creation. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities.
In my daily life, I mainly use social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter to connect with friends and family, as well as to follow my favorite influencers and brands. I have always appreciated the convenience and accessibility of these platforms for staying connected with others. However, I have also become more aware of the potential risks and limitations of relying too heavily on social media, such as the impact on mental health and privacy concerns.

For content creation, I use a variety of tools such as Canva and Adobe Spark to create graphics and videos for personal projects. I have also recently discovered the potential of using video editing software like Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere to enhance my content and make it more visually appealing.

In terms of research data management, I have primarily relied on Google Drive for storing and organizing my academic papers and projects. I have also used Microsoft Excel for basic data analysis, such as creating charts and graphs. However, I have come to realize that these tools may not always be sufficient for more complex data manipulation and analysis.

The digital humanities course has opened my eyes to the vast array of technology and tools available for research data management and analysis. I have learned about tools such as Tableau and Gephi for data visualization and network analysis, as well as programming languages like Python and R for data manipulation and analysis. I am fascinated by the potential of these tools to revolutionize the way we approach and analyze data, and I am eager to learn more about how to apply them in my academic and professional life.

Despite my prior experience with technology and my newfound knowledge from the digital humanities course, I still feel that my abilities in this area are limited. I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field.

In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a university student taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been eye-opening and enriching. I have come to appreciate the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis, and I am eager to continue learning about how to effectively utilize these tools in my academic and professional life. While I have some basic skills in content creation and social interaction, I am aware that there is still much more to learn and I am eager to continue to expand my knowledge and abilities in this area.

# Step 3 - Rewritten Version:
- Rewritten to reflect my progress.

I am currently a sophomore student at New York University Abu Dhabi majoring in psychology and minoring in visual arts. I am taking a digital humanities class, ***Introduction to Digital Arts & Humanities***, alongside my major and minor requirment classes. Growing up in a digital world, I have always been interested in the digital realm and what goes on within it. So, taking this digital humanities course has been greatly informative and helpful. I have always been surrounded by media and different platforms with many usages, like convenience and academic support. However, I never truly understood the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis until I started taking this introductory course in digital humanities. Nevertheless, this class has been teaching me about specific tools that can satisfy specific needs within the digital lens. 

I use social media, especially Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat, every day to keep up with friends and family. I use it to follow my favorite influences and social media accounts too. Most of the content I follow online is fashion and music based. I am always glad that social media is often easy to use and manage. It brings lots of conveience in communicating with others and expressing messages to a louder audience, and you often get to pick your target audience through hashtags and the accounts you tag or follow. However, social media feels addicting most of the time and getting out of the loop feels hard from time to time. This is reflective of the algorithm's nature of being never-ending. That's one of the cons of social media, especially that its easilly accessible.

For data management and storage, I have always relied on Google Drive and manually storing my files on my desktop through organized folders. I personally prefer the latter, however, I am aware of the convenience that comes with digital ways of storing data online. It's more accessible for personal use as well as collaborative work with others. I have used Google Drive for classwork, assignment submission, and groupwork with classmates.

I persoanlly have minimal background on content creation, apart from simple social media posts like on Instagram. However, I thankfully find it easy to catch-on and learn how a specific program works with some familiarization. I have been getting familiar with different programs that generate different types of content for different usages, like Voyant Tools and Orange. These visualization tools take input and process it while outputting visualization of the analyzed corpora. The content generated by these programs has aided in my academic progress and development. I learned a lot about image-based analysis and text analysis from a corpus.

Most of the data I have used came from online sources, like the Digital Library of the Middle East (DLME) which hosts thousands of different items to be scanned and analyzed through different online tools. This has opened many different doors of possibilities for the data that can be combined and forged into datasets to be analyzed based on specific themes or not. Through understanding the contents of online sources is when I truly got to grasp the idea of metadata as the data that makes up an entity online. It helps us track it down, and it allows us to differentiate it from other similar pieces of data. This further boosted my knowledge surrounding data organization. Broman & Woo (2018) decipher how data should be organized online for easier access and more practical recommendations.

The current level of exposure I am at right now is greatly different to the one I was in during the first weeks of this digital humanities class. Now, I am more aware of how the digital scene works. Nevertheless, I still have a long way to go upon mastering the ability of acknowledging online data, if that's even possible. I am aware that there is so much more to learn, and I am excited to continue to expand my skills and knowledge in the field.

In conclusion, my digital literacy journey as a university student, mainly not studying digital humanities, taking an introductory course in digital humanities has been eye-opening and enriching. I am starting to appreciate the potential of technology for research data management, data manipulation, and analysis even more. I am extremely intriguied of what is yet to come in learning about how to effectively utilize these tools in my academic and professional life. While I am starting to better navigate my way around data and know how to deal with it and analyze it, I know that I still have a long way to go and to learn.

# Step 4 - End-of-year Reflection on the Prompt:

I am currently a 19 year old sophomore student at New York University Abu Dhabi majoring in psychology and minoring in visual arts.

However, social media feels addicting most of the time and getting out of the loop feels hard from time to time. This is reflective of the algorithm's nature of being never-ending. That's one of the cons of social media, especially that its easilly accessible.
As we have been learning about how search engine patterns can be used for text analysis processes, I have been intrigued by the role of social media in all of this. A research study done using Chinese search engines to track general search trends amongst the nation revealed different political stances and ideologies that people hold. Clark et al.'s study showcased how text can stand as a great way into understanding how a specific culture and community thinks/acts. Their collected data was also plotted along linegraphs to depict time and place of the search query. This can further allow for mapping tools to be utilized and implemented. However, when using such tools, one must make sure that the used data is accurate and from reliable sources. If the used data of images for mapping are fake, AI generated, or just inaccurate, the results will be useless and dangerous to share.

In an article talking about this, Kim Eckart provides an example of "image spoofing". This term refers to a fake image being used. This image can be formed by combining images of different locations and mapping them as a *real* geographical locations, or it can be totally AI generated based on general trends of how geographical satellite images look. This brings up many issues within the space of mapping and utilizing pre-existing images. However, me starting to become more familiar with the digital scene and understanding how AI is developing and forming, I am somewhat able to differentiate between reliable sources and ones that aren't. Though, it is extremely challenging and difficult.

For data management and storage, I have always relied on Google Drive and manually storing my files on my desktop through organized folders. I personally prefer the latter, however, I am aware of the convenience that comes with digital ways of storing data online.
